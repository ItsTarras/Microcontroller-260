ENCE260 Assignment 2.

The following instructions are steps on how to play the memory game on the microcontroller.

1. Start both controllers. They will be on, as indicated by the startup LED sequence, followed by
    "Player 1 push button" being displayed.

2. Player 1 should push the button, and this will send player 2 into receive mode. While in receive mode,
    Player 2 will have a blank board.

3. Player 1 will be told to "ADD" a command. Player 1 will use the joystick, and input the direction they want
    to add to the command array.

4. Player 1's LED will turn off. Player 2's will turn on to signify it's their turn. 

5. Player 2 will have a countdown display. After this hits 0, it will relay the sequence to them, which they must copy, which will be communicated by their LED flashing when it's done.

6. If they relay the sequence correctly, it will be their turn to "ADD" a command.

7. Repeat this until someone messes up.

8. The boards will display "Loser" and "Winner" respectively.

9. If the players want to play again, click the middle joystick when displaying "Winner" or "Loser". They will be sent back to the player selection phase.
